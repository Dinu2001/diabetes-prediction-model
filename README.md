ðŸ§  Model Files

This project includes pre-trained machine learning components saved as .pkl files:

scaler.pkl â†’ StandardScaler object used to normalize the input features before prediction.

model.pkl â†’ Trained Random Forest model used to predict diabetes outcomes.

Both files were serialized using Pythonâ€™s pickle module.
They can be loaded directly in any Python environment to perform predictions without retraining the model.
